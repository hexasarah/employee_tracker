// WHEN I start the application
// THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
// This requires node.js and the specified schema:

            // department

            // id: INT PRIMARY KEY

            // name: VARCHAR(30) to hold department name

            // role

            // id: INT PRIMARY KEY

            // title: VARCHAR(30) to hold role title

            // salary: DECIMAL to hold role salary

            // department_id: INT to hold reference to department role belongs to

            // employee

            // id: INT PRIMARY KEY

            // first_name: VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name

            // last_name: VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name

            // role_id: INT to hold reference to employee role

            // manager_id: INT to hold reference to another employee that is the manager of the current employee (null if the employee has no manager)


// WHEN I choose to view all departments
// THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids

// WHEN I choose to view all roles
// THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role

// WHEN I choose to view all employees
// THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to

// WHEN I choose to add a department
// THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database

// WHEN I choose to add a role
// THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database

// WHEN I choose to add an employee
// THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database

// WHEN I choose to update an employee role
// THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database
